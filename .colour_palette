# Note that what is described as yellow may be brown on some terminals, whereas
# what is described as white may appear gray.
# In addition to the colors, there are various special codes:

# * 0 restores the default colors (foreground # and back- ground)
# * 1 produces brighter colors
# * 4 produces underlined text,
# * 5 produces flashing text.

# Often 5 doesnâ€™t work; however, many consider the effect to be distracting so
# this is really not an issue for most users. Also, keep in mind not all
# terminals are capable of underlining and as a result code 4 may produce some
# other effect.

# We need to surround all non-printing characters with special escape
# sequences. These sequences will tell the shell that the enclosed
# characters don't take up any space on the line, which will allow
# word-wrapping to continue to work properly. Without them, you'll end up with
# a nice-looking prompt that will mess up the screen if you happen to type in a
# command that approaches the extreme right of the terminal.

# Modifications have been made such the shell will detect if it's not a bash
# shell, and **will then assume it's an instance of zsh**, and use the
# appropriate escapes according to the shell-type.
